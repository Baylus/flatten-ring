# flat-souls
2D Darksouls-like game that is trained via genetic algorithms

NOTE: I actually have only played like an hour of DS3, but a good amount of elden ring so I will be using terminology appropriate to this.

### Input/Output definitions

#### Tarnished
It may be possible to replace the time remaining in actions with a general current tick for both parties, which may allow them to utilize that information not only for the enemy's actions but also their own.
##### Inputs:
 - X Position
 - Y Position
 - Current Angle
 - Margit X
 - Margit Y
 - Margit's current action
 - Margit's angle
 - Time remaining in Margit action
###### Maybe:
 - Health of Tarnished
 - Health of Margit

We will need Margit's current angle so that Tarnished knows whether it is in the area of margit's current attack
##### Outputs:
 - Left
 - Right
 - Forward
 - Back
 - Turn Left
 - Turn Right
 - Attack
 - Dodge

##### Inputs:

 - Current Angle
 - Tarnished X Position
 - Tarnished Y Position
 - Tarnished's current action
 - Tarnished's Angle
 - Time remaining in Tarnished action
###### Maybe:

We will need Tarnished's current angle so that Margit knows whether it is in the area of margit's current attack, and where tarnished is dodging to.

 - Right
 - Forward
 - Back
 - Turn Left
