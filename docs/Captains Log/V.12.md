# V.12

After 500 generations, Tarnished is still running off the edge... I am going to penalize him a ton for it. He may just avoid moving very much, but at least it will teach him that he has to survive, and then he will start to learn to not do repeated actions, which is the very penalty that he is scared of to the point of running off the cliff as soon as he can.

## Changes

- Massively increasing the penalty for running off the cliff. Also including a scaler to falling off that will account for all the time that was missed by the bot running off the cliff, to make sure he isn't incentivized to run off before his repeat action penalty goes up too high.
