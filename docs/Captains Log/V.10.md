# V.10

So, stuff I have noticed from watching the replays is that Tarnished doesn't know well enough to avoid doing repeat actions. So he ends up losing more and more fitness points. However if he runs off the edge, he can't repeat actions, so he does that before he makes a ton of mistakes.

So, I am ramping up rewards a ton and toning down a ton those penalties, nearly eliminating them. Specifically the action penalty is cut to 10%. At this point, doing a new action will pay for 5 repeat actions, which means that it will start getting rewarded fairly quickly by doing new actions.

I am also cranking up a variety of pure rewards, like surviving, proximity to margit, and dealing damage (I know, a pipe dream for sure). I also want to enforce that it doesnt fall off the cliff. At this point, there should be enough reward for moving around with Margit that he will risk moving around the edges, hopefully.

## Changes
- Cut repeat action penalty to 10%
- Increase survival factor
- Increase reward from proximity to Margit
- Increase reward from dealing damage
- Increase reward from winning
- Increase penalty for falling off the cliff
