# V0.1 Fitness

First experiences seeing them just stand still and swing at each other while staring.

They were prioritizing more connections than less, so they were more likely to choose a bunch of different actions, which would mean that the priority system would take over and force that attack action to take precedence.

Only seen a couple of generations, but I feel like it would be best to change the fitness earlier over later.
My ideas would be to take away the penalty from the Tarnished for taking more damage than Margit, but increase its reward from coming out on top. Also slightly incentivizing it to stay alive, but not by a ton, because I dont want it running away from a fight.

# V0.2

Turns out I am storing fitnesses not by integers, so its making these logs impossible.

So end of first huge run, got through 11 generations. Cancelling it because Tarnished just wants to keep skating off the cliff.

He is still yeeting himself. Going to up that penalty a ton.

# V0.3

Turned down the enticingness of the black void pits. Gave linear fitness points for each point of damage that
Tarnished deals to margit. Need to tune down the connectability of Margit so he doesnt just
sit there at his spawn spamming blades. Havent seen him throw a single dagger yet...
