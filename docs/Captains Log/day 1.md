# V0.1 Fitness

First experiences seeing them just stand still and swing at each other while staring.

They were prioritizing more connections than less, so they were more likely to choose a bunch of different actions, which would mean that the priority system would take over and force that attack action to take precedence.

Only seen a couple of generations, but I feel like it would be best to change the fitness earlier over later.
My ideas would be to take away the penalty from the Tarnished for taking more damage than Margit, but increase its reward from coming out on top. Also slightly incentivizing it to stay alive, but not by a ton, because I dont want it running away from a fight.
