The big topic. I am going to list out some thoughts I have to review them later, but I am figuring that there are some important points for each that we want to discourage in some way.


##### Tarnished
Some points we want to encourage:
- Fighting with Margit, and winning preferably
- Making good use of rolls and avoiding terrain or getting trapped
- Not getting hit by abilities, since they are telegraphed well
- Hitting attacks

Things we would love to discourage:
- Running and hiding
- Being terrified of the pits, wont go anywhere near them
- Not attacking
- Missing attacks

Now, most of this can be generally measured via the HP bars of both units, so I
will be doing that mostly. I will also include measures to check if the Tarnished fell
to their deaths, as that should be slightly discouraged. I may want to ignore HP in cases like that
because it might be intimidating for the AI to take massive damage suddenly and then criticize themselves too severely.

###### Margit
Encourage:
- Landing attacks
- Diversity of attacks
- Predicting dodges
- Pressuring or using pits advantageously
- Winning
- 

Discourage:
- Losing. Margit as many advantages over Tarnished
- "trading even", with Tarnished.
